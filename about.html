                <ul>
                    <li> 1904 – Birth
                        April 22: J. Robert Oppenheimer is born in New York City, USA, to a wealthy Jewish family.</li>
                    <li> 1925 – Academic Beginnings
                        Oppenheimer enrolls at Harvard University and later graduates with a degree in chemistry. He
                        then
                        goes
                        to University of Cambridge to study theoretical physics.</li>
                    <li> 1929 – PhD
                        Oppenheimer completes his PhD at the University of Göttingen in Germany, studying under Max
                        Born. He
                        becomes proficient in quantum mechanics and begins making significant contributions to the
                        field.
                    </li>
                    <li> 1930s – Academic Career
                        Oppenheimer works at various universities, including Caltech and UC Berkeley, where he
                        establishes a
                        reputation as a brilliant physicist and a popular teacher.
                        He begins to study nuclear physics and theoretical atomic structures.</li>
                    <li> 1941 – Pre-Manhattan Project Involvement
                        As World War II intensifies, Oppenheimer becomes involved in the early stages of atomic
                        research,
                        primarily working on uranium enrichment and nuclear chain reactions.</li>
                    <li> 1942 – The Manhattan Project
                        September: Oppenheimer is appointed as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, a
                        secret
                        U.S.
                        government project aimed at developing an atomic bomb during World War II.
                        He moves to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where a team of scientists, including many notable
                        physicists,
                        begin
                        working on the bomb.</li>
                    <li>1945 – Trinity Test and Hiroshima
                        July 16: The first successful test of an atomic bomb, the Trinity test, takes place in the New
                        Mexico
                        desert. Oppenheimer famously quotes the Bhagavad Gita, saying, "Now I am become Death, the
                        destroyer
                        of
                        worlds."
                        August 6 and 9: The United States drops atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and
                        Nagasaki,
                        leading to Japan’s surrender and the end of World War II.</li>
                    <li> 1945-1946 – Post-War and Controversy
                        After the war, Oppenheimer becomes a prominent advocate for international control of nuclear
                        weapons
                        and
                        a key figure in shaping post-war science policy.
                        He faces internal conflicts, particularly regarding the development of the hydrogen bomb, which
                        he
                        opposes.</li>
                    <li> 1947 – Director of the Institute for Advanced Study
                        Oppenheimer becomes the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,
                        where
                        he
                        continues his work in theoretical physics and influences the next generation of scientists.</li>
                    <li> 1954 – Security Hearing and Fallout
                        Amidst the McCarthy era and growing anti-communist sentiment, Oppenheimer’s political
                        associations
                        and
                        opposition to the hydrogen bomb draw suspicion.
                        April: He faces a security clearance hearing (The Oppenheimer Security Hearing), which results
                        in
                        the
                        revocation of his security clearance due to accusations of past Communist sympathies and
                        concerns
                        about
                        his opposition to nuclear weapons proliferation.</li>
                    <li> 1961 – Death
                        February 18: Oppenheimer dies of throat cancer at the age of 62 in Princeton, New Jersey.</li>
